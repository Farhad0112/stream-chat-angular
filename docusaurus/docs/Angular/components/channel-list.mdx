The `ChannelList` component renders the list of channels.

The `ChannelList` displays channels using pagination, new channels are loaded if the user clicks the "Load more" button.

## Customization

**Example 1** - Using a custom channel list component

If you want to create a custom channel list component, here is how to use it:

```html
<custom-channel-list></custom-channel-list>
<stream-channel>
  <stream-channel-header></stream-channel-header>
  <stream-message-list></stream-message-list>
  <stream-message-input></stream-message-input>
</stream-channel>
```

:::note
If you want to create your own message list, you can use the `ChannelService` to receive the channels and interact with the Stream API.

Other building blocks, that you might find useful:

### Loading indicator

The `ChannelList` component uses the [`LoadingIndicator`](./loading-indicator.mdx) component to display a spinner while more channels are being fetched.

### Icons

The `ChannelList` component uses the [`Icon`](./icons.mdx) component to display icons.

**Example 2** - Using a custom channel preview component

If you only want to customize the channel preview items (not the whole list), see example [here](./channel-preview.mdx/#customization).

## Inputs

### customChannelPreviewTemplate

By default, the [default preview component](./channel-preview.mdx) is used. To change the contents of the channel list, [provide your own custom template](./channel-preview.mdx/#customization).
