The Angular Chat Messaging Component Library includes everything you need to build a fully functioning chat user experience in Angular with support for rich messages, reactions, image uploads and more. There are three important building blocks for Angular integration, we have made them available as npm packages:

- **Chat API client** - this is the interface between Chat rest APIs and your chat components, built using plain JavaScript. It makes it very easy to communicate with chat APIs e.g., sending a message, connecting to chat, creating channels etc.
  - Source - https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-js
  - npm - https://www.npmjs.com/package/stream-chat
- **Angular Component SDK** - This provides ready-made UI components that can simply be plugged into your app without building your own UI components.
  - Source - https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-angular
  - npm - https://www.npmjs.com/package/stream-chat-angular
- **Component styles** - We maintain a separate repository for the stylesheets of the web chat UI components.
  - Source - https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-css
  - npm - https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stream-io/stream-chat-css

We recommend you use our component SDK. Chat applications have a lot of moving parts and the Chat Component SDK handles all the stateful chat logic for you to make integration easy. Furthermore, the components offered are highly customisable allowing you to seamlessly incorporate your chat application into your existing application experience. That being said, for various reasons you may choose to build all of your chat UI components yourself, in which case you can still use our Component SDK and take adventage of the Angular services.

Before reviewing the Chat API docs, we recommend having a look at the [tutorial](https://getstream.io/chat/angular/tutorial/).
